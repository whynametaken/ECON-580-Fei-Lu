1) nano filename.txt
 git add then commit
 Changes are saved by git commit -m '' command

	git diff: it shows the latest chage
	git status: shows what files are modified, and stuff you need to do
	git log -1: shows the first edit
	git checkout (version/ID) : changes the file to whichever wanted version

2) From git to github:
git remote add origin + SSH link from github
git remote -v: check origin + check connected to github

	SSH keys pair generation: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C 'email'
 (if you have done it once on a laptop, don't need to do it again)
	
	copy the SSH public key to Github to establish connection
		cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

git push origin main: uploades local files to Github
git pull: needed if git push fails (when repository work doesn't match 
directory?)

3) collaborator work:
git clone + github repo SSH link + ~/Desktop/directory (creates new 
directory and tells the files where to go)
cd ~/Desktop/directory (go to file directory to access files)
